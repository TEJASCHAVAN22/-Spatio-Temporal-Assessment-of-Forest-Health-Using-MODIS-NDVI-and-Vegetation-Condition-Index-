# -Spatio-Temporal-Assessment-of-Forest-Health-Using-MODIS-NDVI-and-Vegetation-Condition-Index-
This study evaluates spatio-temporal forest health dynamics using MODIS NDVI and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Long-term satellite data (2003–2023) are analyzed in Google Earth Engine to identify vegetation stress patterns and assess forest condition variability over time and space.
